# unmicrosofted-winpkg

## Why this?
The official build of `winpkg-cli` contains telemetries from Microsoft and there isn't an easy way to disable it.

This project builds the `winpkg-cli` from source code without telemetries and data collectors.

## Next?
Add scoop manifest to make it installable from scoop.
